## Fixes
### Agent page search
The search function on the agent page is now fixed. Previously, search tokens disappeared while typing the search text. Now, you can search on the agent page with autocompletion.

### Backwards compatible tag validation
Previously, when call and trace analytics tags were renamed, custom dashboards and saved analytics views that referenced the old tags showed validation errors. The validation error is fixed, and now previous tag names are also recognized as valid tag names.

### Synthetic monitoring
Hotfixes were applied to Instana 281 for the following issues. The fixes are available on Instana 282.
- If you clicked the **View Related Test Results** tab from the Event page, the **Summary** tab on the Synthetic test results kept reloading. This issue is fixed.
- Synthetic tests could not be created due to 414 error, the internal request URI was too large. This issue is fixed.
