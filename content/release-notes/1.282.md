## Features
### Business monitoring
Business monitoring is no longer an add-on feature and is now included in the observability standard package. For more information, see [Business Monitoring](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=instana-business-monitoring). 

### File Monitoring sensor
The File Monitoring sensor is a new sensor that monitors and provides events as per user configurations.

### SAP ABAP sensor
This release adds the following updates to the SAP ABAP instance dashboard in the Instana UI:
- Printer availability metrics on the **Transactional Statistics** tab.
- Update record metrics on the **System Overview** tab.
- System and user profile configuration on the **System Overview** tab.
- RFC error logs on the **Transactional Statistics** tab.

### Support for Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) 21c
The Oracle RAC sensor supports Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) 21c. For more information, see [Monitoring Oracle Real Application Clusters](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=oracledb-monitoring-oracle-real-application-clusters).

## Improvements
### Action and Access log now part of Audit trail
**Action log** and **Access log** are now grouped under **Settings** > **Team Settings** > **Audit trail**.
Existing bookmarks are still functional.

## Fixes
### Backwards compatible tag validation
Previously, when call and trace analytics tags were renamed, custom dashboards and saved analytics views that referenced the old tags showed validation errors. The validation error is fixed and now previous tag names are also recognized as valid tag names.

### Agent page search
The search function on the agent page is now fixed. Previously, search tokens disappeared while typing. Now, you can search on the agent page with autocompletion.
