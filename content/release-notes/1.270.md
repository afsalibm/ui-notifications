# Build 270

2024-04-02

## Features

### AWS RDS

Instana now supports the metric EBSIOBalance% for monitoring AWS RDS.

### Azure Machine Learning

Instana now supports monitoring Azure Machine Learning.

## Improvements

### Better search in tag or metric catalog

Searching the catalog for tags and metrics yields more relevant results. Previously, searching for the word "namespace" used to return namespace labels for CRI-O and ContainerD as the first results. Now, when you search for "namespace", Kubernetes namespace UID, name, and labels are the first results. Also, search terms are now highlighted. And searching can also be scoped within a category.

### Refine Instana-hosted PoP deployment status

Now, Synthetic monitoring uses the activation queue and deployment status to influence the reported status of the activation of an Instana-hosted PoP. This process prevents the activation from being reported in error status too quickly.

### Improved performance in Analyze Infrastructure

- Loading the entity list is faster when no metrics are selected
- Commonly used tags are optimized for filtering and grouping

### Additional parameters for GetTraces API

You can now use the optional `includeInternal` and `includeSynthetic` parameters in the [GetTraces](https://instana.github.io/openapi/#operation/getTraces) API to control inclusion of internal and synthetic calls in the filtered output, just like for other APIs that support a `tagFilterExpression` parameter.

### Search functionality on the Agent Details page

Now you can search for Agent zones on the Agent Details page.

### Trace details

You are now informed about the following options:
- Retries when the trace details take longer to load
- Possible causes if the trace cannot be found even after 3 unsuccessful retries

### Alert notifications: Incremented alert about end-of-life Ruby runtime

Starting with Ruby sensor 1.6.6, an alert is displayed in the Instana UI when a Ruby runtime that is older than Ruby 3.1 end-of-life (EOL) is detected.

## Fixes

### Monitoring NGINX

The parsing of `geo` blocks in the NGINX configuration files is fixed.

### Synthetic monitoring

 * Now, the filter label on the **Locations** tab in the Synthetic UI is **Type** instead of **Location**.
 * Now, if the Synthetic monitoring Open APIs are used from the UI, the user's Limited access to Synthetic tests is enforced.
 * Now, the datacenter activation message format is correct, allowing for an accurate translation of the message.
