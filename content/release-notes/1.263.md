## Build 263

2023-12-05

## Features

## Analyze Infrastructure

The Analyze Infrastructure feature is now available for general use. If you are not familiar with this feature, please see the [Analyze Infrastructure](https://github.ibm.com/instana/docs/blob/main/src/pages/analyze_infrastructure/index.md) documentation.

## Business Monitoring

A Business Monitoring widget is added to the Instana homepage to help you quickly view your business processes and star them. For more information, see [Business monitoring](https://github.ibm.com/instana/docs/blob/main/src/pages/business_monitoring/index.md).

## Azure Data Factory

Instana now automatically discovers and monitors Azure Data Factory. For more information, see [Monitoring Azure Data Factory](https://github.ibm.com/instana/docs/blob/main/src/pages/ecosystem/azure-datafactory/index.md).

## IBM WebSphere Liberty sensor: Add JMS metrics

IBM WebSphere Liberty now supports JMS data monitoring. For more information, see [Liberty performance metrics](https://github.ibm.com/instana/docs/blob/main/src/pages/ecosystem/websphere-liberty/index.md#performance-metrics).

## Node.js Tracer

Node.js Tracer now supports the following service versions:
- Google Cloud Storage 7
- Fastify 4.24

## Improvements

## Elasticsearch Sensor: Added support for Elasticsearch 8.1.3

The Elasticsearch sensors now support monitoring metrics and configuration data for Elasticsearch 0.17.0 to 8.1.3.

## Host sensor memory metrics

More memory metrics is added for host sensor on AIX, and percentage values for `swap used` value is added on Linux and AIX.

## IBM ACE Tracing

The `CICS_SUPPORT` property is added to trace context propagation for the Customer Information Control System (CICS) request. If the `CICS_SUPPORT` property is set to `on` in IBM ACE Tracing, the trace correlation information is added to the CICS request. Default is `off`. For more information, see [Configuring Instana ACE Tracing](https://github.ibm.com/instana/docs/blob/main/src/pages/ecosystem/ace/index.md#configuring-instana-ace-tracing).

## Infrastructure linking

The reliability of infrastructure linking for HTTP calls that are implicitly using the default HTTP or HTTPS ports is improved.

## Kubernetes cluster identification by UUID

Kubernetes clusters are now identified by their universally unique identifiers (UUID). The corresponding feature flag (`identifyK8sClusterByUuid`) now defaults to `true`. 

## Logging: Improved error message for query timeout

The queries that time out within **Logs** and **Unbounded Analytics** now display a specific error message that indicates the query timeout, rather than a generic one.

## Logging: Commonly used tags in filters

The commonly used tags are now visible within the **Add filter** dropdown menu to enable faster log filtering in the **Logs** view in **Unbounded Analytics**.

## Fixes

## IBM ACE Tracing

Previously, the ACE user exit couldn't be loaded correctly on AIX when it was installed to a nondefault directory. This issue is fixed now.

## Unbounded analytics

The issue that caused an error to appear when you filter and group by Podman tags is now fixed.
