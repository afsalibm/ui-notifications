## Fixes

### Business monitoring
If the business activity has no name, the Business monitoring dashboard shows the activity type instead of a blank string by default.
 
### Call details
Occasionally failing to load the details of recent calls is now fixed.
 
### Synthetic monitoring
  - If you edited a Synthetic test that included a .js file with strings, you were unable to save the file and an incorrect and misleading error message appeared. This issue is fixed.
  - An issue that caused Synthetic test details to be removed before the retention period is fixed. The test details retention is corrected and retained for 60 days. The issue did not affect Synthetic test results retention.

### Cassandra sensor
The issue of not discovering a particular node as a Cassandra for the DataStax Enterprise (DSE) 4.6 is now fixed.
