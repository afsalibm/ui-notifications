## Breaking Changes

### Enabling Two-Factor Authentication to create, update, or delete automation actions
To provide enhanced security, [Two-Factor Authentication](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/current?topic=two-factor-authentication-2fa) is required to create, update, copy, or delete actions.

## Features

### Business monitoring
The events dashboard on the Event page now displays a table of business processes that are impacted by the affected entity.
 
### OpenTelemetry: Instana backend HTTP support for OTLP metrics
The Instana backend now supports receiving OpenTelemetry OTLP metrics in HTTP format. For more information, see [Sending OpenTelemetry data to the Instana backend](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/current?topic=sending-open-telemetry-to-instana-backend.md).
 
### OpenTelemetry-based sensor SDK (beta)
The OpenTelemetry-based sensor SDK (beta) now supports generic metrics for operation systems and AI, including various large language models (LLMs) and LLM applications. For more information, see [OpenTelemetry-based sensor SDK (beta)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/current?topic=open-telemetry-based-sensor-sdk).

## Improvements

### Support for Elasticsearch 8.8.2
The Elasticsearch sensor now supports monitoring metrics and configuration data for Elasticsearch 0.17.0 to 8.8.2.
 
## Fixes

### Business monitoring
If the business activity has no name, the Business monitoring dashboard shows the activity type instead of a blank string by default.
 
### Call details
Occasionally failing to load the details of recent calls is now fixed.
 
### Synthetic monitoring
  - If you edited a Synthetic test that included a .js file with strings, you were unable to save the file and an incorrect and misleading error message appeared. This issue is fixed.
  - An issue that caused Synthetic test details to be removed before the retention period is fixed. The test details retention is corrected and retained for 60 days. The issue did not affect Synthetic test results retention.

### Cassandra sensor
The issue of not discovering a particular node as a Cassandra for the DataStax Enterprise (DSE) 4.6 is now fixed.
