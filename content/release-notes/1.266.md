## Build 266

2024-02-06

## Features

### AWS AppSync

Instana now automatically discovers and monitors AWS AppSync. For more information, see [Monitoring AWS AppSync](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/current?topic=technologies-monitoring-aws-appsync).   

### Azure Service Bus

Instana now automatically discovers and monitors Azure Service Bus. For more information, see [Monitoring Azure Service Bus](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/current?topic=technologies-monitoring-azure-service-bus).

### Azure Storage

Instana now automatically discovers and monitors Azure Storage Blob metrics. For more information, see [Monitoring Azure Storage](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/current?topic=technologies-monitoring-azure-storage-service).

### IBM API Connect

The IBM API Connect sensor now supports monitoring of IBM API Connect for provider organization, catalog, and space metrics. For more information, see [Monitoring IBM API Connect for provider organization metrics](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/current?topic=connect-monitoring-api-provider-organization-metrics-beta).

## Improvements

### IDE-friendly stack trace for supported languages

- The stack trace in the log details for Calls on the Analytics page is now shown in the format of the programming languages that are used in Instana.
- **Copy** is now added to the StackTrace section so that you can copy and paste the stack trace to your integrated development environment (IDE) for further investigation. IntelliJ and most of the other JetBrains IDEs support the analysis of external stack traces.
- Instana currently supports the following languages:
    - JavaScript or TypeScript (node)
    - PHP
    - Python
  
### Improved layout of email alerts

The layout of alerting emails is now improved to better reflect the status and severity of incoming alerts and to display alert data in a more readable format.

### MySQL sensor

The MySQL sensor now automatically monitors MySQL 8.0.0 and later. You do not need to manually add the MySQL driver JAR file to the Instana agent **deploy** folder. For more information, see [Monitoring MySQL](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/obi/current?topic=technologies-monitoring-mysql#mysql-version-800-and-above-support).

### Synthetic Monitoring

* The number of retries, retry interval, and timeout interval can be set for a Synthetic test in the **Create Synthetic Test** dialog in advanced mode.
* The calls from a Synthetic test can be filtered. To filter the calls, the **Mark Synthetic Call** checkbox is added in the **Create Synthetic Test** dialog (in advanced mode). You can view and edit these parameters on the **Configuration** tab on the Synthetic test page.

* The preview of scripts on the **Configuration** tab on the Synthetic test page is enhanced.

## Fixes

### Call charts: Discrepancy in latency data

If latency is less than 1 ms, the call charts incorrectly showed “No data available”. If no data is available, the Erroneous Calls (per second) chart incorrectly showed 0 in the time buckets. Now, this issue is fixed.

### Native histogram metric support

- Integer overflow occurs during histogram conversion if the current count for a histogram bucket is less than the previous count. An integer overflow causes the bucket counts to exceed 4,000,000,000 on custom dashboards that use the histogram widget. This issue is now fixed.

* The custom dashboard histogram widget sometimes displayed the retrieval in-progress symbol indefinitely instead of the histogram. This issue is now fixed.

### Synthetic monitoring

* The **Create Synthetic Test** dialog had checkboxes to select an application. Multiple applications could be selected. This issue is now fixed. Checkboxes are replaced with radio buttons. Only one application can be selected.

* The **Test Type** section in the **Create Synthetic Test** dialog (in advanced mode) could be hidden with an extra click on the header. This issue is now fixed. The **Test Type** section can't be collapsed.
