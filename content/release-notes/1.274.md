# Build 274

2024-05-28

## Features

### SSL certificate tests
Synthetic monitoring supports a sample API script to test webserver certificates. A new test type, SSLCertificate, is added to create SSL certificate tests. 

## Improvements

### IBM PowerHMC sensor: vNIC adapter details
You can view the IBM PowerHMC vNIC adapter details of each managed system in Platforms > IBM PowerHMC > Systems > Network in the Instana UI. 

### Synthetic monitoring
Filtering on GET /api/synthetics/settings/locations and GET /api/synthetics/settings/tests is expanded. 

## Fixes

### Business monitoring
The business processes table on the Events page is now fixed to show only the relevant business processes.

### Fixed order in the API query window
The default order in the API query window, which was incorrect and did not support grouped results, is now fixed. Additionally, the order now updates correctly when modified in the table.

### Synthetic monitoring
The number of Synthetic tests displayed in the Access Configuration panel for Groups included the tests that were deleted. This issue is fixed, the number of deleted tests is excluded from the count.
