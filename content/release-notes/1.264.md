## Features

### AWS Lambda runtime support for Node.js 20.x

Node.js Tracer now supports the AWS Lambda Node.js 20.x runtime.

### Azure App Service support for Node.js Tracer

### Details of Android app crashes (beta)

Details of Android app crashes are available in the mobile app dashboards as a beta feature. Instana supports the translation of obfuscated Java code in the stack trace of Android apps.

### IBM MQ Tracing

The IBM MQ Tracing user exit now supports both generating and sending the OpenTelemetry span data to OTLP receivers.

### Node.js 21 support for Node.js Tracer

Instana now supports Node.js 21. However, a known issue with broken [ESM support](https://github.com/nodejs/loaders/issues/147) exists since Node.js 20.

### PHP Tracer 2: ARM64 support

PHP Tracer 2 now supports ARM64 starting from version 2.1.1. You can get the same capabilities with ARM64 as you get with AMD64.

### PHP Tracer 2: cgroup v2 support

PHP Tracer 2 now supports cgroup v2. You can manually deploy PHP Tracer 2 into containerized environments.

### PHP Tracer 2: PHP 8.3 support

PHP Tracer 2 now supports PHP 8.3 starting from version 2.1.1. You get the same capabilities with PHP 8.3 as you get with PHP 8.2.

## Improvements

### Actions lane for Kubernetes charts

The Actions swimlane is added in Kubernetes charts.

### Action scripts on Windows and macOS

Instana supports the `RunAs` configuration for action scripts on Windows and macOS platforms. 

### Dynamic parameters for automation actions

The event severity, source, state, text, and type are added to the tag catalog list for dynamic parameters in automation actions.

### Elasticsearch sensor: Add support for Elasticsearch 8.3.3

The Elasticsearch sensor now supports monitoring metrics and configuration data for Elasticsearch 0.17.0 to 8.3.3.

### Network File System Monitoring

Instana now supports Reads and Writes per second for Network File Filesystems (NFS).

### PHP sensor: Autoupdate capability

Starting from PHP sensor 1.2.5, stable releases of PHP Tracer 2 are now automatically deployed for all supported versions.
For versions unsupported by PHP Tracer 2, the last stable release of PHP Tracer 1 remains in place.

### Synthetic Monitoring

- If you do not have the 'canUseSyntheticCredentials' permission and attempt to create a Synthetic test with credentials, a message shows up in the UI. This message explains that the test cannot be created due to the lack of permission.
- The message that appears when you delete a Synthetic test or a Synthetic location is enhanced. The expected UI behavior after deletion is included in the message.

## Fixes

### Apache HTTPd Tracing

Previously, after Apache HTTPd Tracing was installed, it couldn't be loaded correctly on Apache 2.4.6. This issue is fixed now.

### IBM MQ sensor

The IBM MQ sensor experienced high CPU usage in some situations when the IBM MQ queue manager had more than 1000 channels. This issue is fixed now.

### IBM MQ Tracing

- The IBM MQ Tracing user exit had issues in loading on AIX when it is installed to a nondefault directory. This issue is fixed now.
- Previously, when messages are sent with a Java program by using IBM MQ native shared libraries, the PUT span was lost. This issue is fixed now.

### PHP Tracer 2: HTTP headers

Previously, the PHP Tracing extension experienced occasional crashes during the processing of HTTP headers. This issue is fixed now.

### PHP Tracer 2: MySQLi query

Previously, PHP Tracer didn't capture calls to [`mysqli::query` or `mysqli_query`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli.query.php) with the second parameter `result_mode`. This issue is fixed now.

### Synthetic Monitoring

- Deleted tests were not removed from the List of Tests page in the Synthetic Monitoring UI. This issue is now fixed. 
- When you edited or paused a Synthetic test created before 12 June 2023, you might see an error message. This issue is now fixed.
- Previously, an error occurred when you tried to view the test results for the Browser tests. This issue is now fixed.
- The 'Browser' property in a Synthetic test was reset if a Browser Script test was edited. This issue is now fixed.
- Previously, a Synthetic test was not getting associated with an application during the test configuration update. The issue is now fixed.
- Previously, when you created a Synthetic test with the **Create Synthetic Test** wizard, the 'Location' selection list was hidden if a long script was entered in the script field. This issue is now fixed.
- Previously, when you created a Synthetic test with the **Create Synthetic Test** wizard, the uploading of a script test bundle caused an error in the UI. The error prevented creating the Synthetic test. This issue is now fixed. Currently, if you try to upload a bundle in wizard mode, an error message appears.
