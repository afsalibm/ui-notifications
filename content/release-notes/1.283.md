# Build 283

2024-09-29

## Features
### Dropwizard sensor
Instana now supports monitoring of all versions of Dropwizard 4.0 and earlier. You can now filter the Dropwizard custom metrics by using a regular expression. For more information, see [Monitoring Dropwizard](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=technologies-monitoring-dropwizard).

### Limited access RBAC for Automation framework
You can select **Limited access** permission scope for **Automation** product area when you create a new user group. For more information, see [Manage user access](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=instana-managing-user-access).

### SAP ABAP sensor
Transport Request metrics are now supported for SAP ABAP. To view the metrics on the Instana UI, go to the SAP ABAP dashboard, and then click the *Transactional Statistics** tab.

### Service level objectives widgets (public preview)
You can now add new service level objectives (SLO) widgets to display and analyze the performance of their services over time on their custom dashboards. For more information, see [Service level objectives widgets (public preview)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=slo-service-level-objectives-widgets).

### Notes and Activity sidebar (public preview)
You can now add comments to the incidents by using the **Notes and Activity** sidebar. For more information, see [Service level objectives widgets (public preview)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=references-analyzing-incidents).

## Improvements
### Column width in service endpoint lists
When there were long endpoint names in **Applications > Services > Endpoints**, users had to scroll horizontally. Now, endpoint names are truncated if they exceed a certain length to keep the list within the window width. The full endpoint name is still visible via the tooltip.

### Display emojis in Slack alert messages
The Slack alert channel configuration now includes a switch **Display emojis**. With this switch, you can control whether Slack messages display emojis. For more information, see the [Slack alert channel](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=apis-slack).

### Enhancements to Calls details and Trace Timeline views
In the **Analytics** dashboard for calls, the following enhancements are made to the **Calls** details view to provide more accurate information for batched calls:
- The label **Latency** is updated to **Sum of latencies**. 
- The label **Self time** is updated to **Elapsed time**.
- Percentage displays are removed.

The **Timeline** view for traces is enhanced to improve the visualization of batched calls. The length of the call bar for batched calls is now determined by the `minSelfTime` value from the `getTraceActivityTree` method, rather than `duration`.

### SAP HANA sensor
The SAP HANA sensor now has the following improvements:
- Collects Virtual Memory, Workload Rate (per minute), Transaction Statistics, and Active Statement metrics.
- Detects partial aborting and aborting transactions.

### Synthetic monitoring
Previously, the location health information in the Synthetic monitoring Tests page was shown with only red or green dots. The **Locations** column is improved to provide a more comprehensive view. It now includes both text descriptions and icons, making the location health information clearer and more accessible.

### Test DBmarlin configuration
It is now possible to test the configuration for your DBmarlin integration within settings. For more information, see [DBmarlin documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=apis-dbmarlin).

## Fixes
### Endpoint configuration for synthetic calls
When an endpoint received only synthetic calls in a certain time window, it was not possible to edit or create custom HTTP rules. This is now fixed.
