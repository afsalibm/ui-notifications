## Features

### Db2 LUW sensor
{: #db2-luw-sensor}

#### Db2 pureScale metrics
{: #db2-purescale-metrics}

The Db2 dashboard now shows [pureScale Page Access Table](../../ecosystem/db2/index.md#purescale-page-access-table), [pureScale Package Cache Table](../../ecosystem/db2/index.md#purescale-package-cache-table), and [pureScale Group Buffer Pool Table](../../ecosystem/db2/index.md#purescale-group-buffer-pool-table).

### Synthetic monitoring browser tests
{: #synthetic-monitoring-browser-tests}

Browser test types in Synthetic monitoring are generally available (GA) now. For more information, see [Using browser tests](../synthetic_monitoring/browser_script/overview.md).


## Improvements

### Deactivate Instana-hosted PoPs
{: #deactivate-instana-hosted-pops}

To stop using an Instana-hosted PoP, you can deactivate the PoP. To deactivate the PoP, click **Deactivate** action on the Synthetic Monitoring page. For more information, see [Disabling Managed locations](../synthetic_monitoring/synmon_managed_location#disabling_managed_locations).

### Finer infrastructure tag suggestions
{: #finer-infrastructure-tag-suggestions}

Infrastructure tag suggestions are tailored based on the current filter.
For example, when you are filtering on a Kubernetes Cluster, adding a Kubernetes Namespace tag to the filter list prompts suggestions for namespaces from the selected cluster.

### Tuxedo sensor
{: #tuxedo-sensor}

Improved the loading time of metrics of the Tuxedo sensor in the **Queues** table. In addition, the drop-down option in each row that contains two charts is now removed. You can click an item in the **Queue Id** column to view the charts.


## Fixes

### Call details layout
{: #call-details-layout}

In certain call details views, the position of the header in the stack trace section was off. The position is now correctly set.

### Synthetic monitoring
{: #synthetic-monitoring}

If a time in the future was entered by using Open API, Synthetic test data was returned. This issue is fixed. Now if a time in the future is entered, an error message is displayed.
