## Features

### Automation policies

An automation policy associates a trigger to an action in your action catalog. A trigger can be either an Instana event definition or a Smart Alert. When an event is raised that matches the conditions specified in the trigger, the policy appears in the **Associated Policies** section of the **Incident** or **Issue** details page. From the **Associated Policies** section, you can run the action that is configured in the policy. Automation policies are a replacement for action associations and all current action associations are converted to automation policies. To work with your automation policies, select **Automation** from the sidebar then select **Policies**.

### Running Turbonomic actions (beta)

The Instana Incident details page now provides a mechanism for initiating the execution of recommended actions from IBM Turbonomic.

### Service Level Objectives (SLO) dashboard (beta)

Instana has a new Service Level Objectives (SLO) dashboard where you can view all of your SLOs with high-level status and drill down into details. This experience provides detailed charts that highlight indicator status, error budget consumption, and visualization of SLOs across various time windows. It is available from the Service Levels top-level menu.

### TIBCO ActiveSpaces monitoring

Instana now supports monitoring Tibco ActiveSpaces (AS). You can now monitor Tibco AS nodes and explore the dashboard in the Instana UI.

### Azure Key Vault

Instana now supports monitoring Azure Key Vault.

### Azure Key Vault Managed HSM

Instana now supports monitoring Azure Key Vault Managed HSM.

### Infrastructure tag catalog API

A new infrastructure endpoint is available that enables retrieval of the tag catalog.

### Prometheus metrics for pods on the Kubernetes dashboard

On the Kubernetes dashboard in the Instana UI, the **Prometheus Metrics** tab is added for pods that contain Prometheus metrics.

## Improvements

### Synthetic monitoring

The [MongoDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb) third-party module is added to the JavaScript playback engine in Synthetic PoP 1.1.6 and later.

### Website monitoring

The backend trace correlation of XMLHttpRequests is enhanced for browser delays.

## Fixes

### MongoDB sensor

The Replication lag metric was missing from MongoDB 5.0 and later. The issue is fixed now.

### Service mapping

Previously, incorrect source service was displayed in the Instana UI when the parent call included a shared exit span. Now, the source service is mapped correctly.

### Synthetic monitoring

Previously, the JavaScript playback engine stopped working after the Instana AutoTrace webhook was installed in the Kubernetes cluster that contained Synthetic PoP. Now, the Instana AutoTrace webhook instrumenting is disabled by default on all containers of Synthetic PoP 1.1.6 and later, which fixed the issue in Synthetic PoP 1.1.6 and later. To fix the issue for the existing Synthetic PoP, you must uninstall the existing Synthetic PoP and reinstall Synthetic PoP 1.1.6 or later.
