# Build 273

2024-05-14

## Features

### Azure PostgreSQL flexible server
Instana now automatically discovers and monitors Azure PostgreSQL flexible server. 

## Improvements

### Automation framework integration with secret managers
You can now retrieve the **Vault** action parameters from all secret managers that the host agent supports.

### Synthetic monitoring
If the access level was Limited access and the user belonged to only one group, the user who created a Synthetic test could not view or modify the Synthetic test until the Instana administrator added the tests to the Limited access list. Now if the access level is Limited access and the user belongs to only one group, all the tests created by the user are automatically added to the Limited access list. The user who created the test can view or edit the test.

## Fixes
The following issues are fixed.

### WebSphere Application Server certificate expiration metric
Previously, the certificates.*.expDaysLeft metric showed negative values for the days past the expiration date. Now, on reaching the expiration date the metric value shows zero, and this issue is now fixed. As a result, the metric is now properly rendered in charts and can be used to trigger alerts in Infrastructure Smart Alerts.
